# Distributed Programming 2022-2023

## Distributed Programming contents for Games & Devel, 3rd semester / IADE

The objectives of this module are:
1. the study of the paradigm of distributed programming, distributed systems, and data communication solutions;
2. the study of the C programming language, and its use in the development of multiplayer games. 

Being an integrated part of a study program that operates in PBL (Project Based Learning), this module aims to transmit to students the knowledge of distributed programming necessary for the development of the semester’s project.


### Timetable 
| Day | Hour | 
| :-----------: | :-----------: | 
| Wednesday | 16:00 - 18:40 | 

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module students should be able to:
1. Program using the paradigm of distributed programming;
2. Know the main models and languages for distributed programming;
3. Assess aspects related with the performance of distributed programs, their advantages, and their shortcomings;
4. Implement client-server and peer-to-peer programs using C sockets, as well as TCP or UDP.

## Program

1. Introduction to distributed systems and distributed programming;
2. Processes, threads and synchronization;
3. Distributed systems architectures and Inter-process Communication;
4. Introduction to C programming;
5. Multiplayer and network communication;
6. TCP and UDP communication in C;
7. Evaluation of distributed systems.

## Attendance

Students can see their attendance [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQXmUbA_pEfSGp1CvN28CubOIn6omHCVuQ9C_zCtLbnYJ9l6600lTdMC1XRzK1d3EPha1e_ggaCPNKI/pubhtml?gid=1412701734&single=true).

## Teaching methodologies 

Students learn, apply the concepts learned, and develop programming skills mainly by working on the semester’s team project. Other active and experiential learning methods are also used. For each topic, students are presented with theoretical concepts and examples of practical implementations applying these concepts, as well as challenged with exercises that explore each concept. Students are encouraged to discuss with each other and with the lecturer.

## Groups
